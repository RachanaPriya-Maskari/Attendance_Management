# Attendance_Management
The Attendance Management Application is a simple yet functional web-based tool designed to streamline the process of managing student attendance. 
This application allows users to add, update, and delete student records, mark attendance for each student, and export attendance data in a CSV format. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and JSON as the database.
